/**
 *
 * Base interface for all objects that behave like a connection. This interface will usually be implemented by the
 * objects that connect to a database, either over the filesystem or sockets. {@link Connection} are not supposed
 * to be thread-safe and clients should assume implementations **are not** thread safe and shouldn't try to perform
 * more than one statement (either common or prepared) at the same time. They should wait for the previous statement
 * to be executed to then be able to pick the next one.
 *
 * You can, for instance, compose on top of the futures returned by this class to execute many statements
 * at the same time:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val handler: Connection = ...
 *   val result: Future<QueryResult> = handler.connect
 *     .map(parameters -> handler)
 *     .flatMap(connection -> connection.sendQuery("BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ"))
 *     .flatMap(query -> handler.sendQuery("SELECT 0"))
 *     .flatMap(query -> handler.sendQuery("COMMIT").map(value -> query))
 *
 *   val queryResult: QueryResult = Await.result(result, Duration(5, SECONDS))
 * }}}
